Assignment-4-SONAR-Image-Processing
This project simulates the process of analyzing sonar images used in marine research to track whale movements.
Each sonar image is represented as an N × N matrix containing integer intensity values (0–255).
The program performs three main operations using only pointer arithmetic — ensuring in-place computation and minimal memory usage. 
=======
Design a console-based calculator program in C that accepts mathematical
expressions as input in the form of strings.

 The program should evaluate the expression and return the result. Supported
operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
 The program should handle integer operations and output the result as an integer,
even if the result of division has a remainder.
