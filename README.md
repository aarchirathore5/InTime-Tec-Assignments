Assignment-3-Student-Performance-Analyzer
The Student Performance Analyzer is a console-based C program that evaluates students’ academic performance based on their marks in three subjects.
It calculates total marks, average marks, assigns grades, and displays a performance pattern using stars (*) according to the grade.
Assignment-4-SONAR-Image-Processing
This project simulates the process of analyzing sonar images used in marine research to track whale movements.
Each sonar image is represented as an N × N matrix containing integer intensity values (0–255).
The program performs three main operations using only pointer arithmetic — ensuring in-place computation and minimal memory usage.
