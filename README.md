Objective

The modulo operator, %, returns the remainder of a division. For example, 4 % 3 = 1 and 12 % 10 = 2. The ordinary division operator, /, returns a truncated integer value when performed on integers. For example, 5 / 3 = 1. To get the last digit of a number in base 10, use  as the modulo divisor.
